# amazon-clone

### Description

This project is a clone of the Amazon website built in my own style with a working cart.

**Technologies i used**

- Html
- Tailwind CSS
- Javascript
- Git

I used these technologies because I they are the main technologies for building front end web apps, I also learnt Tailwind whilst building this project so I can use it in the future.

**Challenges i faced**

This project taught me a-lot about the javascript language that I didn't already know, here are a few:

- Storing information even when the user closes the browser with localStorage. 

- Learning RegExp in order to add Email and Password Validation.

- Working with ES6 Export and Import.

**Features I hope to implement in the future**

- Sign in functionality.
- Keep for later in the cart.
- Allow user to leave reviews.
